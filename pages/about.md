I am Tim McGilchrist. I currently work as a Software Engineer/Functional Programmer with [Tarides](https://tarides.com) working
with OCaml.

I find functional programming interesting and effective for solving problems. Mostly I use OCaml and Haskell
but have known Erlang, Elixir, Lisp and Standard ML at various times. My interests are compilers,
distributed systems and operating systems.

I help organise the Sydney based Functional Programming group, [FP-Syd](https://www.meetup.com/FP-Syd/).

My open source contributions are mostly on [github.com/tmcgilchrist](https://github.com/tmcgilchrist).

I occasionally use Twitter via [lambda_foo](https://twitter.com/lambda_foo) and [Linkedin](http://au.linkedin.com/in/timmcgilchrist)

Sometimes I look like this:

Outside of computing I enjoy music, MTB riding, growing plants and being outdoors.

I can be contacted at [lambda_foo](https://twitter.com/lambda_foo) on Twitter or email timmcgil@gmail.com.
