In preparation for a talk I'm presenting I've been revisting papers writen about
ML module system, especially how it compares to Haskell's type classes. The most
appropriate paper on the subject has been "ML Modules and Haskell Type Classes:
a Constructive Comparison" by Stefan Wehr and Manuel Chakravarty. The paper
"introduces type-preserving translations from modules to type classes and vice
versa, which enable a thorough comparison of the two concepts."

Unfortunately for my purposes the comparisons are done between Haskell and
Standar ML, I'd prefer they were in OCaml. So I
