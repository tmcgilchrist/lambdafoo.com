<h2>Welcome</h2>

<p>Welcome to my corner of the internet.</p>

<p>
  My name is Tim McGilchrist. I currently work as a Functional Programmer and Squad Lead at Digital Asset in Sydney.
</p>

<p>
  I find functional programming interesting and effective for solving problems. Mostly I use OCaml and Haskell
  but have known Erlang, Elixir, Lisp and Standard ML at various times. My interests are compilers,
  distributed systems and operating systems. I give talks on these topics at user-groups and conferences.
  If you are interested in me speaking, let me know via email: timmcgil@gmail.com
