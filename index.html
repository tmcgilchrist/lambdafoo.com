<h2>Welcome</h2>

<p>Welcome to my corner of the internet.</p>

<p>I am Tim McGilchrist. I currently work as a Functional Programmer and Squad Lead at Digital Asset in Sydney.</p>

<p>I find functional programming interesting and effective for solving problems. Mostly I use OCaml and Haskell
but have known Erlang, Elixir, Lisp and Standard ML at various times. My interests are compilers,
distributed systems and operating systems.</p>

<p>I've reproduced a list of recent posts here for your reading pleasure:</p>
