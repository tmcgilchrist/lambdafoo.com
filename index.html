<h2>Welcome</h2>

<p>
    My name is Tim McGilchrist. I'm a Principal Software Engineer at <a href="https://tarides.com">Tarides</a>,
    where I work on the OCaml compiler and runtime.
</p>

<p>
    My current focus is making OCaml programs easier to debug and profile. That means getting backtraces
    to actually work, adding frame pointers and CFI support across architectures (Power, RISC-V, ARM64, s390x),
    and making tools like perf, eBPF, and LLDB useful for OCaml. I'm building debugging infrastructure
    through libraries like <a href="https://github.com/tarides/mach">mach</a>,
    <a href="https://github.com/tarides/object">object</a>, and
    <a href="https://github.com/tmcgilchrist/durin">durin</a> (for parsing DWARF debug info).
    I also work on garbage collection internals and general systems hacking.
</p>

<p>
    Before OCaml, I worked extensively with Haskell. I contributed to
    <a href="https://github.com/hedgehogqa/haskell-hedgehog">Hedgehog</a> (property-based testing),
    <a href="https://github.com/icicle-lang/">icicle</a> (a streaming query language), and
    <a href="https://github.com/haskell-distributed/">Cloud Haskell</a> (distributed computing).
    I've also spent time with Erlang, Lisp, and Standard ML.
</p>

<p>
    I maintain several OCaml libraries including
    <a href="https://github.com/tmcgilchrist/ocaml-grpc">ocaml-grpc</a> and
    <a href="https://github.com/tmcgilchrist/ocaml-gitlab">ocaml-gitlab</a>.
    I help organise <a href="https://www.meetup.com/FP-Syd/">FP-Syd</a>, Sydney's functional programming meetup.
</p>

<p>
    I give talks at conferences and user groups. If you're interested in having me speak,
    email me at timmcgil@gmail.com.
