# Freer Monads, More Extensible Effects

# Outline

"Freer Monads, More Extensible Effects" paper by Oleg Kiselyov and Hiromi Ishii.

May contain traces of Free Monads, no understanding required.

# Motivation

Acknowledge the issue being addressed, composability of Effects ie Monads.

There are 3 approaches proposed for addressing this:
  1. Monad Transformers (transformers/MTL)
  2. Combine monads via a co-product
  3. Effects as an interaction and having effect handlers

???
2 is Data types ala carte
3. Eff language

Extensible effects emerge as a combination of free monads and open union
2 & 3.

---
# Effects as Data

``` haskell

data Reader i a =
    Pure a
  | Get (i -> Reader i a)
```
--
``` haskell
data Writer o a =
    Pure a
  | Put o (() -> Writer o a)
```
???
Having a look at effects as data types
--

```haskell
data ReadWrite i o a =
    Pure a
  | Get (i -> ReadWrite i o a)
  | Put o (() -> ReadWrite i o a)
```


???
Not extensible.
Data types are closed union

---
# Effects as Data cont

```haskell
instance Monad (ReadWrite i o a) where
  return = Pure
  Pure x >>= k = k x
  Get k' >>= k = Get (k' >>> k)
  Put u k' >>= k = Put x (k' >>> k)
```

* Not extensible
* Data types are closed union

???
Monad instance for Reader Writer.

(>>>) Kleisli composition, is the composition of effectful functions

Common pattern here.

---
# Free Monad

``` haskell
data Free f a =
    Pure a
  | Impure (f (Free f a))

```
Pure represents no requests, while Impure are the requests.

Containing the continuation that receives the reply.

Instances of `f` define the effect signature of a particular effectful computation.
???

---
# Free Monad cont

```haskell
instance Functor f => Monad (Free r) where
  return = Pure
  Pure a >>= k = k a
  Impure f >>= k = Impure (fmap (>>= k) f)
```
???
* free monad's compose because they're based off functors which do compose.
* free monad recover a free monad from the data type definition.
* tricky bit is writing the interpreter

---
# Freer Monad
```haskell
data FFree f a where
  Pure :: a -> FFree f a
  Impure :: f x -> (x -> FFree f a) -> FFree f a

```
Insight, make the `fmap` external

???
In this way we can remove the Functor constraint.

---
# Freer Monad cont

```haskell
data FReaderWriter i o x where
  Get :: FReaderWriter i o i
  Put :: o -> FReaderWriter i o ()

instance Monad (FFree f) where
  ...
  Impure fx k’ >>= k= Impure fx (k’ >>> k)

```
???
* more common pattern of accumulating continuations
* more general, it imposes less constaints than before
* Monad instance but also the Functor and Applicative instances for free.
* Direct access to the continuation means no rebuilding the mapped data like with fmap
* Can change the representation of the continuation to be more efficient. More on this later

---
# Extensible Effects

`A Monad type is extensible if we can add a new effect without having to touch or even recompile the old code.`

???

* transformers doesn't provide this?
* Bloody stupidly designed Monad Transformer stack
* Modeling the Effects as a data type is not extensible.

---
# Open Union

`Union (r :: * -> *) x`

The first argument r is a type level list of effect labels.
The second argument is the response type.

A concrete union has a single effect label and response type.

???
* A way of describing effects, that's extensible

---
# Effect Isolation

Next we'd like to talk about effects in isolation, the `freer` library provides this typeclass.

``` haskell
class Member t r where
  inj :: t v -> Union r v
  prj :: Union r v -> Maybe (t v)
```
???
This allows us to assert a label `t` occurs in the list `r`.
Impure takes a concrete union of a single effect and response type,
a function from `x` to `FEFree r a` and gives you that.
---
# FEFree

```haskell
data FEFree r a where
  Pure :: a -> FEFree r a
  Impure :: Union r x -> (x -> FEFree r a) -> FEFree r a

data Reader i x where
  Get :: Reader i i
data Writer o x where
  Put :: o -> Writer o ()

ask :: Member (Reader i) r => Eff r i
ask = Impure (inj Get) return
```
???
Pure is fairly straight forward.

Impure takes a concrete union of a single effect and response type, a function from `x` to `FEFree r a` and gives you that.

---

# Performance Issues

The original `Free` monad while elegant had poor performance.

``` haskell
addGet :: Int -> Reader Int Int
addGet x = ask >>= \i -> return (i + x)

(((return >>> addGet) >>> addGet) >> addGet) 0
...
((Impure (inj Get) return . (+0)) >>= addGet) >>= addGet
...

```

???

* bind traverses the left argument but passes around the right argument
* performs poorly on left-associated list appends
* [31] "Reflections without remorse: Revealing a hidden sequence to speed up monadic reflection" by Oleg

---

# Final Result

``` haskell
data FEFree r a where
  Pure :: a -> FEFree r a
  Impure :: Union r x -> (x -> FEFree r a) -> FEFree r a
```

* with request continuation exposed, represent it in other ways

???

--
``` haskell
instance Monad (FEFree f) where ...
  Impure fx k' >>= k = Impure fx (k' >>> k)
```

* represent the continuations as a concrete sequence [31] "Reflections without remorse..."

---
# Final Result II
``` haskell
type Arr r a b = a -> Eff r b
```
* type appreviation for the request continuation.

``` haskell
type FTCQueue (m : * -> *) a b ...

tsingleton :: (a -> m b) -> FTCQueue m a b
(|>) :: FTCQueue m a x -> (x -> m b) -> FTCQueue m a b
```
* type aligned sequence minimal interface `Data.FTCQueue`
* enforce the variant, the result type of one function matches the input of the next one.

# Performance Evaluation

 * For deep monad stacks, EE runs in constant time, while MTL takes linear time in the number of layers. Also 40% faster than previous EE based off Free
--

 * Cost of deep MTL stacks is severe. Implications for design.
--

 * Memory usage for EE is linear with the number of layers. MTL is quadratic in the number of layers. EE is more memory efficient than MTL
--

 * State benchmark shows MTL is 30 times faster than EE. Special optimisation passes for MTL State :-)
--

 * Non optimised version the performance between EE and MTL is comparible

???

State is a special snowflake with dedicated optimisations.

Trying to replicate results with 7.10 and 8

# Conclusion

 * Removing fmap constraint
 * Represent continuations as type aligned list
 * Externalise fmap
 * Promising performance vs Free and MTL

---
# Examples
 * Catching IO Exceptions
 * LogicT, non-determinism with comitted choice
 * Monadic Regions
