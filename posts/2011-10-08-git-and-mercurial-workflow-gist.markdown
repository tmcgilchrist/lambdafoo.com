Just added some gist notes on my git and mercurial workflow.

Switching between the two does my head in sometimes.

Probably not that interesting for git or mercurial experts but just something to
jog my memory when I have to switch. I've got them taped to my desk right beside
my note book of Emacs keybindings.
