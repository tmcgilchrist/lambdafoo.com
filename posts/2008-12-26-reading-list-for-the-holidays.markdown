My holiday reading list.

 * [Into Thin Air](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Into_Thin_Air) by Jon Krakauer (Mountain climbing aka living dangerously through others)
 * [Dealers of Lightning](http://www.amazon.com/Dealers-Lightning-Xerox-PARC-Computer/dp/0887309895) by Michael Hiltzik (About Xerox PARC )
 * [Real World Haskell](http://www.realworldhaskell.org/) (Sadly its on back order but their website has the full text)
 * [Peopleware](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peopleware) (Project / team management stuff)

Hoping the computer/work related topics give me some motivation and great ideas for 2009.

What are **you** reading over the next couple of weeks?
