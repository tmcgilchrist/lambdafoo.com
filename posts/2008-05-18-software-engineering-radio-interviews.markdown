Here are some interesting interviews I came across the other day on
[SE Radio](http://www.se-radio.net), and thought I'd post them up
here.

The first one is [Joe Armstrong](http://armstrongonsoftware.blogspot.com/), from
[Programming Erlang](http://www.pragprog.com/titles/jaerlang/programming-erlang) fame, talking about Erlang
[[1]](http://www.se-radio.net/podcast/2008-03/episode-89-joe-armstrong-erlang).

The second one is [Dick Gabriel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_p_gabriel)
on Lisp
[[2]](http://www.se-radio.net/podcast/2008-01/episode-84-dick-gabriel-lisp). He's
famous for his involvement in CommonLisp, Emacs and as the founder of the Lisp
company Lucid.
