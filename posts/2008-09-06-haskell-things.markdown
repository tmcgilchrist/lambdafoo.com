Just wanted to share a few good Haskell links that I've come across.

Software Engineering radio just recently had an
[interview](http://www.se-radio.net/podcast/2008-08/episode-108-simon-peyton-jones-functional-programming-and-haskell)
with Simon Peyton Jones, Haskell god and functional programming guru. A great
listen for the commute and a great accent.

[Writing a Lisp Interpreter in Haskell](http://www.defmacro.org/ramblings/lisp-in-haskell.html),
not sure how I came across this but it's a super article about writing a simple
lisp interpeter in Haskell complete with source code to mess about with.

[Haskell for C Programmers](http://www.haskell.org/~pairwise/intro/intro.html),
a gentle introduction to Haskell for those more familar with the imperative
model of programming.

I'm also trying to get along to the local
[Sydney Functional Programmers](http://groups.google.com.au/group/fp-syd) group,
I've only been once. They have a google group page and hold monthly meetings.
