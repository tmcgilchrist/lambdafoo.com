I finally posting my slides for the WebMachine talk I gave at
[ErlSyd](http://www.meetup.com/Sydney-Erlang-User-Group/events/49204512/).

The content was fairly general WebMachine and REST stuff, going into how to
setup, build and structure a WebMachine application.

I'm planning on putting together something more detailed in the future, as the
current WebMachine resources are rather spartan. The plan is to do an extended
series of posts or a github/ebook site ala [learnyousomeerlang](http://learnyousomeerlang.com/).

Again the slides are up on github @ [github.com/tmcgilchrist/webmachine_talk/](https://github.com/tmcgilchrist/webmachine_talk/).
