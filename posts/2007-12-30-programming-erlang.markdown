I've been interested in functional programming languages ever since I was
introduced to [Haskell](http://www.haskell.org/) as part of an undergrad course
at UNSW. At the time it was a huge change from my usual diet of Java and C, but
after struggling with it for a semester I found that I really enjoyed it.

Since then I have dabbled with Prolog and CommonLisp, as well as revisiting
Haskell.

Currently I am working through
[Programming Erlang](http://www.pragprog.com/titles/jaerlang) by Joe Armstrong.
Erlang is another functional language focusing on distributed concurrent
appplications. It has a number of unique features including hot swapping of code
and lightweight processes built into the language. Despite only reading the
first couple of chapters it looks like the Pragmatic Programmers have produced
another brilliant book.

Looking forward to getting my hands dirty with Erlang.
