It looks like blastwave has updated their version of Postfix to 2.4.6 which
isn't the latest but is much better than the 2.3 version they previously
had. But the exciting news for me is it now includes a SMF manifest.

Some time ago I attached a copy of my manifest to an existing bug, hoping that
one of the package maintainers would have time to update the official version to
include a manifest and now it does. Hopefully it came in handy for whoever
actually did the updating.

Nice work. Now to upgrade my version.
