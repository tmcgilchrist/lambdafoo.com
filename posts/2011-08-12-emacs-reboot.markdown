I'm trying out a little experiment for the next few week. I'll be using Emacs as
my Ruby/Rails environment today and hopefully every few days until I'm really
rocking my emacs-fu. During the day I'll note what I don't know how to do or
doesn't work the way I'd like, and try to find a solution for that the next time
I'm using Emacs.

I've been somewhat *meh* about IntelliJ/RubyMine for a bit. They're both nice
enough but it feels like I'm only using them as a fancy editor and everything
else (git/rspec/cucumber/rails) gets run in a terminal. Plus a few things are
really annoying me, code completion kind of sucks, memory usage of the IDE is
quite high and the refactoring support is not what it should be.

I've started with a blank slate, forked the
[emacs-starter-kit](https://github.com/tmcgilchrist/emacs-starter-kit) and so
far only customised the colour theme.

Here's to more productive emacs sessions.
