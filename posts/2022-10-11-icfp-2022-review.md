I wrote up a [highlights of ICFP 2022](https://tarides.com/blog/2022-10-10-icfp-2022-review) for the Tarides blog. It was great to get back to in-person conferences again and getting the chance to meet people. Thanks to my employer Tarides for covering the cost.

For me personally the OCaml Workshop was fantastic beginning to end, read the blog post for the full details.
Outside of OCaml I spent time in the Haskell Implementors Workshop, hearing about the new features for GHC and excited by the progress that Cabal is making.

My take away research topics are:

 * Typed Effect Systems especially [Koka](https://github.com/koka-lang/koka).
 * Delimited Continuations for both OCaml and Haskell.
 * Lockfree data structures, [Reagents](https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/reagents) and [STM](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/stm).
