Earlier this year I spoke at
[Yow! LambdaJam](http://lambdajam.yowconference.com.au) about RAFT and Erlang. I
thought I should link to my talk descriptions and slides [here](https://a.confui.com/-kpclGeyK).

On the first morning of the conference I spoke about the RAFT distributed
consensus algorithm and how it could be implemented in Erlang/OTP. The slides
are
[here](http://yowconference.com.au/slides/yowlambdajam2014/McGilchrist-RAFTImplementingDistributedConsensusWithErlang.pdf)
with the video to follow sometime later. I was very happy with how the talk went
despite many pre-conference nerves and will surely be submitting something next
year.

In the final workshop slot of the conference I presented an Erlang workshop on
building a Webmachine system for shortening urls. The source code on github [here](https://github.com/tmcgilchrist/erlang_from_scratch).

Yow! LambdaJam is a great conference that brings together the functional programmers
from across Australia. I personally had a great time and would encourage anyone
who is interested in functional programming to come along next year. We had
talks on Erlang, Haskell, Idris, Scala and Clojure. I'm hoping next year we see
something on OCaml and F#.
