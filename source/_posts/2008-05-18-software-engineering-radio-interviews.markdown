Here are some interesting interviews I came across the other day on <a href="http://www.se-radio.net">SE Radio</a>, and thought I'd post them up here.

The first one is <a href="http://armstrongonsoftware.blogspot.com/">Joe Armstrong</a>, from <a href="http://www.pragprog.com/titles/jaerlang/programming-erlang">Programming Erlang</a> fame, talking about Erlang <a href="http://www.se-radio.net/podcast/2008-03/episode-89-joe-armstrong-erlang">[1]</a>.

The second one is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_p_gabriel">Dick Gabriel</a> on Lisp <a href="http://www.se-radio.net/podcast/2008-01/episode-84-dick-gabriel-lisp">[2]</a>. He's famous for his involvement in CommonLisp, Emacs and as the founder of the Lisp company Lucid.
