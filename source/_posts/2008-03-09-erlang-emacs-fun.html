As part of learning Erlang I needed a decent editor. I tried using <strong>vi</strong> but it just didn't have the right level of integration. So I'm now using <strong>Emacs</strong> and it seems to be a pretty good fit. I'm by no means an advanced Emacs user and I'm sure there are plenty of cool things you can do with Erlang but I you need to start somewhere.
</p>
<p>
So here is the configuration for getting an Erlang emacs mode, drop it into your .emacs file.
</p>
<pre>
(setq load-path (cons  "/opt/local/lib/erlang/lib/tools-2.6/emacs"
                       load-path))
(setq erlang-root-dir "/opt/local/lib/erlang")
(setq exec-path (cons "/opt/local/lib/erlang/bin" exec-path))
(require 'erlang-start)
</pre>
<p>
I'm using the Erlang installed by MacPorts, which installs into <strong>/opt/local</strong>, adjust the path for local conditions.
</p>

A few useful commands to get you started:<br />

C-c C-z (erlang-shell-display) - Start, or switch to, an inferior Erlang shell.<br />

C-c C-k (erlang-compile) - Compiles the Erlang module in the current buffer.<br />

C-x` (erlang-next-error) - Move the point on to the next error.<br />

C-c C-c (comment-region) - Comment or uncomment each line in the selected region.<br />

where <strong>C</strong> is Control and the second element is a letter pressed at the same time.

All the features of the Erlang mode are described by switching to Erlang mode (M - erlang-mode) and describe the mode (M - describe-mode), where <strong>M</strong> is the Meta key. Usually the <strong>Alt</strong> or <strong>Option</strong> key on a Mac.
