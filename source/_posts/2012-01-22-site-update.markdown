Rather lax in my updates.

So a few updates for those interested.

I attended YOW! and Erlang Factory Lite in Brisbane late last year, and had an
absolute blast. Met lots of cool people and got inspired to do more this year.

Went to the workshop about REST by Jim Webber, and got a great new perspective
about RESTful architectures along with some gentle ribbing due to me being the
only Ruby/Rails guy in attendance.

Shout out to OJ for organising the Erlang Factory Lite. He's talking at Erlang
Factory in San francisco about Riak, so go along and say hi.

I've been wanting to update my blog for a while so I bought a domain name or two
and converted the site off Wordpress. For now it's living on github pages and is
very much a work in progress. More details to come.

Other than that I've been hard at work on a few Ruby and Erlang projects, and am
excited to be attending a few local Sydney user groups. This month I was at RoRo
http://www.rubyonrails.com.au/ and there is an Erlang group starting up next
month which I'll be at.
