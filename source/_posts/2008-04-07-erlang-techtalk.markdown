I've just discovered the Google TechTalk series on YouTube and have been working
-my way through them. The latest find is a great talk on
-[Erlang](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpYPKBQhSZ4) that is well worth listening to.

You can browse the whole collection at
[Google TechTalks](http://www.youtube.com/user/googletechtalks).
