Just testing the iPhone app for posting to my weblog. It seems to work correctly. Cool.

A few other issues recently have conspired to stop me posting, like server failure and adsl modem failure.

Currently I am refreshing my memory about Haskell for this semester's Uni course. Some more details and code when I can.
