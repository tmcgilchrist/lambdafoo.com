Using IntelliJ on Ubuntu 10.10

Wanted a pretty launcher in my menu.

Found this site:

http://www.dotkam.com/2010/06/16/intellij-idea-ubuntu-launcher/

Followed instructions and got a pretty launcher.

Only improvement I could add is to have an

/opt/intellij-current directory and use

sudo ln -s /opt/idea-IU-99.18 /opt/idea-current

to redirect it around to point to the current version of IntelliJ you have.
