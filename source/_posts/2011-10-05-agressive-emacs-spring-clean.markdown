A few weeks ago I mentioned that I was going to start using Emacs regularly for my Ruby/Rails development.

Well it turned into a rather deep dive into Emacs customisation and the results
so far are very pleasing. Something about starting from scratch is very
liberating and I've found the customisation process very easy this time. So far
I have Emacs 24 setup with ECB, Rinari, ELPA and a whole host of Ruby/Rails
modes on both OS X and Ubuntu Linux.

Everything is up on [github](https://github.com/tmcgilchrist/.emacs.d).

I've still got my old configuration files hanging around in personal-lisp, which
I will gradually migrate over. The top of that list is getting my Erlang mode
and Distel working again.
