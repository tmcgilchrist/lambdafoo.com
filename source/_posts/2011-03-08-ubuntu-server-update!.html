I posted a while ago about switching to Ubtuntu for my home server.

I've got the basics up an running on my Â MacMini. Namely DHCP/DNS/WWW

The setup of DHCP was easy enough. Followed the find documentation on the Ubuntu site.Same story for a caching DNS.

Setup Apache/PHP/MySQL was a quick 'sudo apt-get install php5-mysql' and I installed Wordpress via subversion checkout.

I've also installed BIND9 as a caching DNS server.

Some services I'm not bothering to migrate:
<ul>
	<li>Subversion, I've switched to github and migrated anything I cared about out of subversion. It was useful at the time I set it up 6 or so years ago, but other/better options exist now.</li>
	<li>MediaWiki, most of the stuff in there was either related to a project in Subversion. So I'll switch to using the github wiki associated with a project. No need to worry about security or keeping software up to date.</li>
</ul>
So all in all a success switching to Ubuntu.

Now onto my wish list:
<ol>
	<li>Ruby/Rails using passenger and Postgres</li>
	<li>virtual hosts in Apache</li>
	<li>monitoring system stats like Memory/CPU etc</li>
	<li>DNS within home network so I can setup aliases like dns.home</li>
</ol>
