I finally posting my slides for the WebMachine talk I gave at
[ErlSyd](http://www.meetup.com/Sydney-Erlang-User-Group/events/49204512/).

The content was fairly general WebMachine and REST stuff, going into how to
setup, build and structure a WebMachine application.

Again the slides are up on github @ [github.com/tmcgilchrist/webmachine_talk/](https://github.com/tmcgilchrist/webmachine_talk/).
