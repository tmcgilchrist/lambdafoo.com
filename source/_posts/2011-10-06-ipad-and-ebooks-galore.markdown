Having recently caved and bought an iPad. It's exceptionally good, much better
than I expected, it's just I need to fight to get it back off my wife and/or
kids.

I've started changing over to using eBooks for all my new technical books, and
getting rid of paper copies. I doing that I found that 2 of my favourite
publishers offer eBook upgrades to paper books you've already bought.

[O'Reilly](http://oreilly.com) offers this:

<address>"Upgrade to the electronic version of any print book you've registered at
 oreilly.com, for just $4.99. "</address>

All you need to do is register an account with them.

[Manning](http://www.manning.com/about/ebooks.html) offers this:

<address>"Free eBook With Every pBook! If you are an owner of a Manning pBook
you can get a free eBook at any time easily from your account."</address>

And [The Pragmatic Programmers](http://pragprog.com/) offer something similar.

So out with the dead trees and in with the bits.
