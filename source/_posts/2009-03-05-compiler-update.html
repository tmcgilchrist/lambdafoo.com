More than a month ago I started writing a compiler for a subset of C in Python. Partially inspired by a blog posting from Steve Yegge and out of a desire to learn Python. 

Well I picked up a copy of Real World Haskell, discovered <a title="Parsec" href="http://legacy.cs.uu.nl/daan/download/parsec/parsec.html">Parsec</a> and now have no desire to go back to the nasty yacc/bison place. The modified parser / interpreter is coming along very nicely and a version should be up on the site when it's in slightly better shape.

<strong>On Python</strong>, I'm still using it every now and then to write short scripts. But more often I'm finding I want to write either Haskell or Erlang code to do the same thing. And really who wants to force themselves to write in a language that doesn't really appeal. The original push behind Python was that Google couldn't be wrong in using it so I was going to learn it but I found I really didn't like the aesthetics of it. It wasn't OO enough and the language doesn't really flow as naturally as I'd like. I'm sure it's a great language but not for me at the moment.

Now onwards with the Haskell
