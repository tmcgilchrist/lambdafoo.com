Listening to a podcast discussing the use of design patterns within ObjC & Cocoa. In particular the command pattern seems like it just boils down to using lambda function within a good functional language. I wonder how many of the design patterns are really a limitation of how OO is implemented incurrent mainstream languages, read Java.
I'm sure I have run across an article from a Lisp guy that rubbishes Design Patterns and basically comes to the same conclusion.

I need to look into how the implementation of lambda functions in ObjC 2 enables the use of these functional techniques.
