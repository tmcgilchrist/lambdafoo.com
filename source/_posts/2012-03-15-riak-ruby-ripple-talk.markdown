I recently presented a talk to
[RoRo Sydney](http://www.rubyonrails.com.au/), the local Ruby UG, on
_Riak and Ripple_.

The content was more on the general side of things, with my purpose
being to introduce the core Riak ideas and give some Ruby code for interacting
with Riak.

The slides are up on github @
[github.com/tmcgilchrist/riak_ripple_talk/](https://github.com/tmcgilchrist/riak_ripple_talk/).
