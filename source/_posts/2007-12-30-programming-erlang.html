<p>
I've been interested in functional programming languages ever since I was introduced to <a href="http://www.haskell.org/">Haskell</a> as part of an undergrad course at UNSW. At the time it was a huge change from my usual diet of Java and C, but after struggling with it for a semester I found that I really enjoyed it.
</p>
<p>
Since then I have dabbled with Prolog and CommonLisp, as well as revisiting Haskell.
</p>
<p>
Currently I am working through <a href="http://www.pragprog.com/titles/jaerlang">Programming Erlang</a> by Joe Armstrong. <ahref="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/erlang_(programming_language)"> Erlang</a> is another functional language focusing on distributed concurrent appplications. It has a number of unique features including hot swapping of code and lightweight processes built into the language. Despite only reading the first couple of chapters it looks like the Pragmatic Programmers have produced another brilliant book.

Looking forward to getting my hands dirty with Erlang.
