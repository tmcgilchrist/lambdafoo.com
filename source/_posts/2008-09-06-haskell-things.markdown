Just wanted to share a few good Haskell links that I've come across.

Software Engineering radio just recently had an <a href="http://www.se-radio.net/podcast/2008-08/episode-108-simon-peyton-jones-functional-programming-and-haskell">interview</a> with Simon
Peyton Jones, Haskell god and functional programming guru. A great listen for the commute and a great accent.


<a href="http://www.defmacro.org/ramblings/lisp-in-haskell.html">Writing a Lisp Interpreter in Haskell</a>, not sure how I came across this but it's a super article about writing a simple lisp interpeter in Haskell complete with source code to mess about with.


<a href="http://www.haskell.org/~pairwise/intro/intro.html">Haskell for C Programmers</a>, a gentle introduction to Haskell for those more familar with the imperative model of programming.


I'm also trying to get along to the local <a href="http://groups.google.com.au/group/fp-syd">Sydney Functional Programmers</a> group, only been once. They have a google group page and hold monthly meetings.
