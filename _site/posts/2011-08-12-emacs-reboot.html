<p>I’m trying out a little experiment for the next few week. I’ll be using Emacs as my Ruby/Rails environment today and hopefully every few days until I’m really rocking my emacs-fu. During the day I’ll note what I don’t know how to do or doesn’t work the way I’d like, and try to find a solution for that the next time I’m using Emacs.</p>
<p>I’ve been somewhat <em>meh</em> about IntelliJ/RubyMine for a bit. They’re both nice enough but it feels like I’m only using them as a fancy editor and everything else (git/rspec/cucumber/rails) gets run in a terminal. Plus a few things are really annoying me, code completion kind of sucks, memory usage of the IDE is quite high and the refactoring support is not what it should be.</p>
<p>I’ve started with a blank slate, forked the <a href="https://github.com/tmcgilchrist/emacs-starter-kit">emacs-starter-kit</a> and so far only customised the colour theme.</p>
<p>Here’s to more productive emacs sessions.</p>
