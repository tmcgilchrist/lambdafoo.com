<p>I’m migrating my home server away from OpenBSD.</p>
<p>The things I was able to setup in OpenBSD have worked very well. Things like DHCP, DNS and SQUID have worked excellently. I found some fantastic guides on http://www.kernel-panic.it/openbsd.html that allowed me to get everything up and working in no time at all. I wont bother posting any details from my setup it’s better to just visit that site and decide which pieces you want.</p>
<p>Why move away? These are surely very personal reasons to make the switch and are not a general condemnation of OpenBSD which is still a fantastic piece of software.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>I wasn’t able to get DHCP &amp; DNS to dynamically update DNS when a new host was added to the network. Instead I had a whole heap of static mappings for computers. Not an ideal situation!</p></li>
<li><p>The upgrade path for OpenBSD confuses me. When a new version comes out how do I upgrade without nuking all my local configuration? I really don’t want to go back through the setup every 6 months when the BSD guys bring out a new version.</p></li>
<li><p>I wasn’t able to get PHP + MySQL + Wordpress to play nicely together. Not being a PHP person I didn’t really grok how to setup the whole thing so I was forced to follow guides written by others. OpenBSD doesn’t really seem to be a Wordpress/PHP platform of choice for many so I struggled to find accurate docs on what to do.</p></li>
<li><p>I wanted to add new services to the server like Ruby/Rails, Java/EE, Python/Django and Erlang/OTP. Doing all this and keeping it current on OpenBSD is more work that I was willing to expend.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>So the solution I’m turning to is Linux and specifically Ubuntu in all it’s glory.</p>
<p>What a spiffy system Ubuntu is? I remember struggling to install Debian way back when but Ubuntu is a pleasure and perhaps a little too easy. Kids these days don’t need to struggle for hours setting up XFree86 or a dodgy network card.</p>
<p>So over the next few weeks I’m migrating the essential services, DHCP, DNS and SQUID to Ubuntu. After that I’ll get a bit funky and start adding this blog on there and other bits and pieces.</p>
<p>Hooray for Ubuntu!!</p>
