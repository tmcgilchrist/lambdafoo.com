<p>Lenses have been on my mind since encountering them last year in the context of Haskell. Much of the literature on lenses has a very Haskell slant so show how they can be used in OCaml.</p>
<p>The theory of lenses and their accompanying prisms and traversals, have been better described by other people. <a href="https://www.fpcomplete.com/school/to-infinity-and-beyond/pick-of-the-week/a-little-lens-starter-tutorial">This</a> article at FPComplete was a particularly good one. I’m just going to cover how to use <a href="https://github.com/pdonadeo/ocaml-lens/">ocaml-lens</a> as a minimal lens implementation.</p>
<p>First since ocaml-lens isn’t in opam, clone the repo locally and open up <code>utop</code>. Then load the <code>lens.ml</code> file into <code>utop</code>.</p>
<p>{%codeblock lang:ocaml%} utop # #use “lens.ml”;; .. {% endcodeblock %}</p>
<p>Starting with a few record types for a car, editor and book.</p>
<p>{%codeblock lang:ocaml%} type car = { make : string; model: string; mileage: int; };;</p>
<p>type editor = { name: string; salary: int; car: car; };;</p>
<p>type book = { name: string; author: string; editor: editor; };; {%endcodeblock%}</p>
<p>Creating a new book is as simple as.</p>
<p>{%codeblock lang:ocaml%} let scifi_novel = { name = “Metro 2033”; author = “Dmitry Glukhovsky”; editor = { name = “Vitali Gubarev”; salary = 1300; car = { make = “Lada”; model = “VAZ-2103”; mileage = 310000 } } };;</p>
<p>{% endcodeblock %}</p>
<p>Given our <code>scifi_novel</code> we can access the editor’s car mileage:</p>
<p>{%codeblock lang:ocaml%} let mileage = scifi_novel.editor.car.mileage;; {% endcodeblock %}</p>
<p>Setting the mileage is a bit trickier, we need to unpack each record:</p>
<p>{%codeblock lang:ocaml%} let second_edition = { scifi_novel with editor = { scifi_novel.editor with car = { scifi_novel.editor.car with mileage = 1000 } } };; {% endcodeblock %}</p>
<p>That’s not really an appealing prospect, can we do better?</p>
<p>Enter lenses, at the most simple level a lense is a pair of functions for getting and setting a property.</p>
<p>{%codeblock lang:ocaml%} (** Lens type definition *) type (’a, ’b) t = { get : ’a -&gt; ’b; (** Functional getter *) set : ’b -&gt; ’a -&gt; ’a (** Functional setter *) } {% endcodeblock %}</p>
<p>With this definition of a lens, modifying the mileage is now:</p>
<p>{%codeblock lang:ocaml%} let a = compose mileage_lens (compose car_lens editor_lens) in _set 10 scifi_novel a;; {% endcodeblock %}</p>
<p>In the background we need to define some lenses for the records above:</p>
<p>{%codeblock lang:ocaml%} let car_lens = { get = (fun x -&gt; x.car); set = (fun v x -&gt; { x with car = v }) };;</p>
<p>let editor_lens = { get = (fun x -&gt; x.editor); set = (fun v x -&gt; { x with editor = v }) };;</p>
<p>let mileage_lens = { get = (fun x -&gt; x.mileage); set = (fun v x -&gt; { x with mileage = v })</p>
<p>};; {% endcodeblock %}</p>
<p>Using these definitions the original lens version of modify the editor’s car mileage works.</p>
<p>The compose operator we used allows us to combine 2 lenses to go from the novel into the editor and then into the car. And compose can be combined with itself to build up arbitarily deep lenses into a structure.</p>
<p>{%codeblock lang:ocaml%} let editor_car_lens = compose car_lens editor_lens;; {% endcodeblock %}</p>
<p>This way of composing can seem backwards, you supply the inner lens first then the outer lens. We can fix that by using the infix operators, open the <code>Infix</code> module and define the same lens:</p>
<p>{%codeblock lang:ocaml%} let editor_car_lens = editor_lens |– car_lens;; {% endcodeblock %}</p>
<p>This feels more intuative reading it left to right. Revisiting our original <code>_set</code> mileage example we can now write it.</p>
<p>{%codeblock lang:ocaml%} _set 10 scifi_novel (editor_lens |– car_lens |– mileage_lens);; (* or even *) ((editor_lens |– car_lens |– mileage_lens) ^= 10) @@ scifi_novel;; {% endcodeblock %}</p>
<p>The infix module comes with some other helpful operators like <code>|.</code> for get and <code>^=</code> for set. All these operators avoid mutation so our code remains pure and referentially transparent.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>There are a heap more things that lenses can do, and while this ocaml-lens package is pretty basic, looking at the hundreds of functions exported by <a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens">Control.Lens</a> in Haskell you can get a good idea of the possibilities. <code>Control.Lens</code> includes all the basic lens functions plus things like:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>prisms</code> which are lenses but for sum types</li>
<li><code>traversals</code> are lenses that focus on multiple targets simultaneously</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="resources">Resources</h3>
<p>I made use of the following resources to write this and took some of the examples and definitions from the following articles. All mistakes are my own and probably accidental.</p>
