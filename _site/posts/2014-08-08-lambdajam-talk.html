<p>Earlier this year I spoke at <a href="http://lambdajam.yowconference.com.au">Yow! LambdaJam</a> about RAFT and Erlang. I thought I should link to my talk descriptions and slides <a href="https://a.confui.com/-kpclGeyK">here</a>.</p>
<p>On the first morning of the conference I spoke about the RAFT distributed consensus algorithm and how it could be implemented in Erlang/OTP. The slides are <a href="http://yowconference.com.au/slides/yowlambdajam2014/McGilchrist-RAFTImplementingDistributedConsensusWithErlang.pdf">here</a> with the video to follow sometime later. I was very happy with how the talk went despite many pre-conference nerves and will surely be submitting something next year.</p>
<p>In the final workshop slot of the conference I presented an Erlang workshop on building a Webmachine system for shortening urls. The source code on github <a href="https://github.com/tmcgilchrist/erlang_from_scratch">here</a>.</p>
<p>Yow! LambdaJam is a great conference that brings together the functional programmers from across Australia. I personally had a great time and would encourage anyone who is interested in functional programming to come along next year. We had talks on Erlang, Haskell, Idris, Scala and Clojure. Iâ€™m hoping next year we see something on OCaml and F#.</p>
