<p>Having recently caved and bought an iPad. It’s exceptionally good, much better than I expected, it’s just I need to fight to get it back off my wife and/or kids.</p>
<p>I’ve started changing over to using eBooks for all my new technical books, and getting rid of paper copies. I doing that I found that 2 of my favourite publishers offer eBook upgrades to paper books you’ve already bought.</p>
<p><a href="http://oreilly.com">O’Reilly</a> offers this:</p>
<address>
“Upgrade to the electronic version of any print book you’ve registered at oreilly.com, for just $4.99.”
</address>
<p>All you need to do is register an account with them.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.manning.com/about/ebooks.html">Manning</a> offers this:</p>
<address>
“Free eBook With Every pBook! If you are an owner of a Manning pBook you can get a free eBook at any time easily from your account.”
</address>
<p>And <a href="http://pragprog.com/">The Pragmatic Programmers</a> offer something similar.</p>
<p>So out with the dead trees and in with the bits.</p>
