<p>It looks like blastwave has updated their version of Postfix to 2.4.6 which isnâ€™t the latest but is much better than the 2.3 version they previously had. But the exciting news for me is it now includes a SMF manifest.</p>
<p>Some time ago I attached a copy of my manifest to an existing bug, hoping that one of the package maintainers would have time to update the official version to include a manifest and now it does. Hopefully it came in handy for whoever actually did the updating.</p>
<p>Nice work. Now to upgrade my version.</p>
